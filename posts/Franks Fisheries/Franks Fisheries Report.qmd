# Frank's Fisheries

This post is another data analysis one, although a the topic has to do with fish. In this post I've taken some online data from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SFG-UCSB/fishery-manageR/master/_data/sample_landings_data_raw.csv) for analysis. This data records the landings of a certain fish species over a few year.

We're going to assume that these records came from a single company, one we'll call Franks Fisheries and see what we can learn. I also feel obligated to point out this kind of analysis may be useful to more than just Frank. Fisheries regulators, competitors, fisheries biologists may also find this information insightful.

If you want to skip all the boring housekeeping, jump straight down to Visualisation and Analysis.

## Data Loading and Cleaning

Here starts all the messy background work I need to do in order to do the actual analysis. I'll load in my data, which I've downloaded from the link above.

```{r}
#| label: Data Loading
#| warning: false
invisible(lapply(c("tidyverse", "janitor", "plotly", "scales", "ggrepel", "patchwork", "RColorBrewer"),
       library, character.only = TRUE))
LandingData <- read.csv("~/Programming/R/Fish Landings/sample_landings_data_raw.txt")

```

Next I take a look at exactly what is in this dataset.

```{r}
#| label: Looking Around
#| warning: false
glimpse(LandingData)
summary(LandingData)
```

This is good, we have about 7000 records here of 8 variables. But the names are pretty bad. They certainly aren't what I want to work with. I'll need to change that, and do some reformatting in the process.

```{r}
#| label: Data Cleaning
LandingData <- LandingData |>
  rename(date = dat, trip.id = trip,
         Gear.type = gr,
         species = sp, length.cm = l_cm,
         weight.g = w_cm) |>
  mutate(date = mdy(date))|>
  select(!yy) |>
  mutate(Gear.type = toupper(Gear.type)) |>
  mutate(across(.cols = c(species, Gear.type), as.factor)) |>
  clean_names()
```

The cleaning has been done. You could just trust me, but I'll show you now anyways.

```{r}
#| label: Confirming Cleaning
glimpse(LandingData)
summary(LandingData)
```

Now to fix some of the issues. I see there's technically two species of fish here. Considering how close the spelling is and that there are only two examples, I'm willing to bet its a typo. Let us clean it up so it wont interfere down the line.

```{r}
#| label: Fix Species Typo
LandingData <- LandingData |>
  mutate(species = str_replace_all(species,
                                   "Caesoi cunning",
                                    "Caesio cuning" )) |> 
  mutate(species = as.factor(species)) |>
  na.omit()
LandingData$gear_type[24]<- "HANDLINE"
summary(LandingData)
```

Lastly, I want to make one slight change. This one is based on domain knowledge. I did some quick conversion of the catches into kilograms, and calculated "Catch per unit effort", a measure used to standardize catch across gear types.

```{r}
#| label: Catch per unit effort
LandingData <- LandingData |> 
  mutate(weight_kg = weight_g/1000) |>
  mutate(CPUE = weight_kg/effort)
```

And that's it. Now let's get into the bit that's exciting.

## Visualisation and Analysis

Let's take a look then. Firstly, I will look at how much Frank's Fisheries caught each year. Then I get to begin turning data into a story.

```{r}
#| label: Total Catch every Year
total.landings<- LandingData |>
  group_by(year = floor_date(date, "year")) |>
  summarise(total_catch = sum(weight_kg)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = total_catch)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#248a9c")+
  #geom_point(size = 1.8, alpha = 0.8, colour = "#248a9c")+
  #geom_line(colour = "#248a9c")+
  labs(title = "Frank's Fisheries Shows Record Breaking Catches in 2014",
       x = "Year", y = "Total Catch(kg)",
       caption = "After a decline and 3 years downtime ending in 2009, landings have grown to an all time high in 2014")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
#total.landings<-ggplotly(total.landings)
total.landings
```

You can see the catch decline after 2004 before falling to nothing for 3 years. However catches resumed in 2010 and rose to an all time high netting over 1250kg. This was a massive increase, more than twice the previous best year.

Who doesn't like a good comeback story?

That does however raise the question, what fueled this massive jump. Did Frank do more trips(maybe by buying new boats?) or more efficient trips( perhaps with better gear or better fishing spots?

```{r}
#| label: Number of Trips per year
#| warning: false
trips_per_year <- LandingData |> 
  group_by(year = floor_date(date, "year"), trip_id) |>
  summarise(num_trips = n()) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = num_trips))+
  geom_col(fill = "#248a9c")+
  labs(title = "More Trips, But Not Enough to Explain Record Year", 
       subtitle = "Growth in trips partially explains 2014's record performance",
       x = "Year", y = "Number of fishing Trips")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
trips_per_year
```

We can see that there was some real growth in trips, but not enough to fuel that massive jump in catch. So I'll test the second theory, that the trips themselves got more efficient.

```{r}
#| label: Fishing Trip Efficiency
#| warning: false
Trip.Efficiency <- LandingData |> 
  group_by(year = floor_date(date, "year"), trip_id) |>
  summarise(total.catch = sum(weight_kg, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  group_by(year) |>
  summarise(annual.mean.catch = mean(total.catch, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = annual.mean.catch))+
  geom_col(fill = "#248a9c") +
  labs(title = "Frank's Fisheries has Rapidly Improved Efficiency since restarting in 2010",
       x = "Year", y = "Average catch per Trip (kg)",
       subtitle = "Improvements in efficiency produced record catches in 2014")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
Trip.Efficiency
```

There we go. There's a massive jump in efficiency especially, culminating in that rock-star year of 2014. It is a combination of more trips and that efficiency responsible for the amazing performance of 2014.

There's a couple things that could have contributed to that efficiency; better tools, better staff, better fishing grounds. Some of this we don't have the information to investiagte, but we can absolutely look into which equipment is the most efficient. That catch per unit effort we use to standardise effort between equipment is a great metric to look at.

```{r}
#| label: comparing average cpue
#| warning: false
gear.comparison <- LandingData |>
  group_by(gear_type) |> 
  summarise(avg_catch = mean(CPUE)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(gear_type, avg_catch), 
             y = avg_catch, colour = gear_type))+
  geom_point(size = 5, 
             stroke = 2, 
             shape = 21, 
             aes(colour = gear_type))+
  geom_segment(aes(x = gear_type, xend = gear_type,
                   y = 0, yend = avg_catch))+
  labs(title = "Gillnets and Spearfishing are the Most Efficient Gear", 
       x = "Gear Types", y = "Average Catch per Unit Effort")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), 
        legend.position = "none")+
  coord_flip()
gear.comparison
```

The Gillnet and speargun are the most efficient fishing gear used by Frank's Fisheries. But that does not tell us their actual catch. We can see the total amount caught with each method.

```{r}
#| label: Total catch per fishing method
total.catch.per.method<- LandingData |>
  group_by(gear_type) |> 
  summarise(total.catch = sum(weight_kg, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(gear_type,  total.catch),
             y = total.catch, colour = gear_type))+
 # geom_col()+
  geom_point(size = 5, 
             stroke = 2, 
             shape = 21, 
             aes(colour = gear_type))+
  geom_segment(aes(x = gear_type, xend = gear_type,
                   y = 0, yend = total.catch))+
  labs(title = "Spearfishing brought in the majority of fish caught",
       x = "Gear Type", y = "Total Catch (kg)")+
    coord_flip()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), 
        legend.position = "none")
total.catch.per.method
```

The speargun was the gear with the highest actual catch. This is not super surprising considering we know its one of the most efficient fishing gear. What is more surprising is that the gillnet had such a low catch.

Let's check on a reason why.

```{r}
#| label: comparing gear usage
gear.usage<- LandingData |>
  group_by(gear_type) |> 
  summarise(num.uses = n()) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(gear_type,num.uses), y = num.uses, 
             colour = gear_type))+
  geom_point(size = 5, 
             stroke = 2, 
             shape = 21, 
             aes(colour = gear_type))+
  geom_segment(aes(x = gear_type, xend = gear_type,
                   y = 0, yend = num.uses))+
  coord_flip()+
  labs(title = "Spearfishing proved the most popular method of fishing", 
       x = "Type of Gear used", y = "Number of Uses")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
gear.usage
```

Finally, let's see how much the gear was used each year.

```{r}
#| label: Gear Usage Each Year
#| warning: false
gear.used<-LandingData |>
  group_by(year = floor_date(date, "year"), gear_type) |>
  summarise(c = n()) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = c, fill = gear_type))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(title = "Change in Gear Usage over the Years",
       x = "Year", y = "Number of uses", fill = "Gear Type")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
gear.used
```

And now we can see, while there was no spearfishing before the shut down, it was a popular fishing method after, and by using the most efficient fishing method, and increasing the number of trips, Frank's Fisheries had a record breaking year in 2014.

## Wrapping Up

All in all, I enjoyed this little analysis. We went into the data, and managed to extract an actual story and gain some understanding from what was otherwise just a couple thousand rows of letters and numbers.

This information could be useful to present to the owners of Frank's Fisheries to explain their success in 2014. It could be important for competitors who want to keep up. It could be important for fisheries regulators who want to understand 2014 and see if it's sustainable.

There's a lot of practical use in uncovering what the data was saying in a situation like this. I'd love to take on another dataset like this and see what I find next time. Until then.

Walk Good.
