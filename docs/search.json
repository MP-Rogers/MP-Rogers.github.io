    "text": "It’s been a while since I’ve sat down to practice using R and looking through data. So this is a chance for me to shake the rust off. I’m trying to write this summary as I go through the process to document my thoughts.\nI started heading over to Kaggle and looked for any dataset I found interesting, I shortlisted a few and this one made the cut.\nWithout further ado, let my load my trusty packages and get started.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n\n\nFirst I’ll bring in the data.\n\ndataset&lt;-read.csv(\"StudentsPerformance.csv\")\nglimpse(dataset)\n\nRows: 1,000\nColumns: 8\n$ gender                      &lt;chr&gt; \"female\", \"female\", \"female\", \"male\", \"mal…\n$ race.ethnicity              &lt;chr&gt; \"group B\", \"group C\", \"group B\", \"group A\"…\n$ parental.level.of.education &lt;chr&gt; \"bachelor's degree\", \"some college\", \"mast…\n$ lunch                       &lt;chr&gt; \"standard\", \"standard\", \"standard\", \"free/…\n$ test.preparation.course     &lt;chr&gt; \"none\", \"completed\", \"none\", \"none\", \"none…\n$ math.score                  &lt;int&gt; 72, 69, 90, 47, 76, 71, 88, 40, 64, 38, 58…\n$ reading.score               &lt;int&gt; 72, 90, 95, 57, 78, 83, 95, 43, 64, 60, 54…\n$ writing.score               &lt;int&gt; 74, 88, 93, 44, 75, 78, 92, 39, 67, 50, 52…\n\n\nAlrighty. So we have 1000 rows, an OK size. We have a field for Race, parental education level, lunch, whether they took a test preparation course, and then their math, reading and writing scores. I notice they have placeholders for the race field, likely to reduce any bias. Its a good move.\nA few questions jump out at me:\n\nDo the different genders score differently?\nDo different Races score differently.\nDoes taking the test prep course make a difference?\nAre Reading and Writing Scores more closely related than Math?\n\nOf these, I’m actually most curious about the last one, so let me work through them all.\n\n\n\nThere should be a couple ways to do this. We can carry out a 2 sample t-test.\n\ndataset&lt;- dataset |&gt; mutate( mean.score = (reading.score + writing.score + math.score)/3)\ngender.t.test&lt;-t.test(mean.score ~ gender, data = dataset, var.equal = FALSE)\nprint(gender.t.test)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  mean.score by gender\nt = 4.1789, df = 997.85, p-value = 3.186e-05\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group female and group male is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 1.979515 5.484516\nsample estimates:\nmean in group female   mean in group male \n            69.56950             65.83748 \n\n\nAccording to this, the female mean score is higher than the male mean score. The difference is statistically significant.\nI could also do an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)\n\ngender.anova&lt;-aov(mean.score ~ gender, data = dataset)\nprint(summary(gender.anova))\n\n             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(&gt;F)    \ngender        1   3477    3477   17.39 3.31e-05 ***\nResiduals   998 199591     200                     \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nBoth agree, there a statistically significant difference between the mean score of the male and female students. The p-value, or chance that these results are due to chance is WAY less than 5%. At this sample size, I’d put some stock behind it.\nIn all honesty, I’d love to go through by Math, Reading and Writing to see if one particular subject has a bigger impact than the others.\n\n\n\nThe next one is a touchy topic. Thankfully the racial groups are designated with identifiers. I havent checked for the Key at the time of writing. A similar test can be be done. in this case an ANOVA is used to test the impact of race.\n\nrace.anova&lt;-aov(mean.score ~ race.ethnicity, data = dataset)\nprint(summary(race.anova))\n\n                Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(&gt;F)    \nrace.ethnicity   4   7164  1790.9   9.096 3.23e-07 ***\nResiduals      995 195904   196.9                     \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nOnce again the results are statistically significant. Now I could do something boring and bring up the mean mean score for each group like so:\n\nd&lt;-dataset |&gt; group_by(race.ethnicity) |&gt; summarise(race.mean = mean(mean.score))\nprint(d)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  race.ethnicity race.mean\n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 group A             63.0\n2 group B             65.5\n3 group C             67.1\n4 group D             69.2\n5 group E             72.8\n\n\nBut I find it may be better to do this graphically. there’s different ways to do this, but box plots are a good way to go. This plot shows the means of each racial group, but also an idea of how widely spread the scores are for each. For example, it lets you know that Race D has the second highest mean test score, but also that scores in thus race are the closest together, with less variation/spread.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe test prep course follows a similar analysis. The reason being that, for the purpose of this exercise, race, gender and whether the student did a test prep course are categorical variables. Students neatly fall into discrete groups.\nIn fact lets approach this one a little differently. Lets look at it graphically first. A lot of times thats better for intuition.\n\ntest.score.scatter&lt;-dataset |&gt; ggplot(mapping = aes(x = test.preparation.course, y = mean.score, fill = test.preparation.course))+\n  geom_violin(alpha= 0.8, show.legend = FALSE)+\n  stat_summary(fun = \"mean\", geom = \"crossbar\", color = \"black\", width = 0.7)+\n  labs(title = \"Mean test scores of students\")+\n  xlab(\"Did they complete the test prep course?\")+\n  ylab(\"Mean Test Score\")\ntest.score.scatter\n\n\n\n\nFrom looking, you can already get a sense that those who did the prep course generally did better. More of those students had higher scores. The lower performing students of the group also performed better than the low performers who didn’t do the course. If you are less comfortable eyeballing it (and checking is always good), we can calculate the p-value with an ANOVA as above.\n\ntest.prep.aov&lt;-aov(mean.score~test.preparation.course, data = dataset)\nprint(summary(test.prep.aov))\n\n                         Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F)    \ntest.preparation.course   1  13382   13382   70.41 &lt;2e-16 ***\nResiduals               998 189686     190                   \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nIn my head, i’m curious to know whether this test prep course is paid for or if there are other entrance requirements. At any rate: the difference is once again signficant.\n\n\n\nNow its time for the final question. This is actually the one i’m most curious about. Are Reading and writing scores more closesly related than math? To me, reading and writing feel like two sides of a coin. Math seems a little further away, so i’ll see what the data says.\n\nlibrary(ggcorrplot)\ntest.scores&lt;-dataset[,c(6:8)]\ncorr.matrix&lt;-cor(test.scores)\nprint(corr.matrix)\n\n              math.score reading.score writing.score\nmath.score     1.0000000     0.8175797     0.8026420\nreading.score  0.8175797     1.0000000     0.9545981\nwriting.score  0.8026420     0.9545981     1.0000000\n\n\nBut everyone loves graphs. So we’ll visualise it to tell a better story.\n\ncplot&lt;-ggcorrplot(corr.matrix, method = \"square\", type = \"lower\", lab = TRUE, title = \"Correlation matrix of student test scores\")\ncplot\n\n\n\n\nThe “redness” indicates closer relationships, as do the higher. To an extent I was right. All the scores are strongly correlated. In other words students who scored one way in say, math would tend to score similarly in reading and writing. However, reading and writing were more strongly correlated than either was to math. Which is about what I assumed\n\n\n\nThis was a good exercise to brush off the dust as far as getting back into my groove with R and analysing data. I genuinely think being able to understand statistics and data is important. While there are people who make this their whole career, I don’t think I’m there yet.\nI do think, career applications aside, I can get more use out of this. As a former lecturer of mine once repeated, “There’s lies, damn lies, and statistics” and a little understanding should help peel back some of those lies. For example, I could have hid a lot in mean score, especially if it turned out the scores weren’t highy correlated. Theres still more questions that these questions unearthed.\nBut even so, I think fostering a mindset of having questions, and knowing how to start finding the answers is important. Lets hope I stick to learning andimporving that aspect of my mind and skillset."

I’m a young Jamaican, a marine biologist and a lover of the ocean.\n\n\n\nMe on a Dive\n\n\nI graduated recently(2022) from the University of the West Indies and now, I am seeing how I can make the best use of my marine biology to support, not just me, but the seas of Jamaica and the wider Caribbean. Marine Biology is a pretty broad field. In fact, I think a good idea for one my first posts is on just how diverse life in the sea is, with some of my favourite organisms.\nCurrently, I work with Kee Farms, a start-up bringing seaweed farming and mariculture in general to Jamaica and the Caribbean. You’ll be hearing more about my work and adventures there as I keep posting. I’m also grateful to be accepted for an internship at the Discovery Bay Marine Lab, which will give me an opportunity to work under more seasoned marine scientists, help out with research, and tighten up my own scuba and scientific skills.\n\n\nAbout This Site\nThis is where I get to share my marine biology stories and fun facts, as well as any analysis I find cool. I find that a lot of science types have trouble communicating exactly what we do, and just how cool it is. This is my attempt to get better at that, and tell some fun stories along the way. In that sense it’s both communication, and documentation. Welcome. Glad to have you along for the ride"

So we needed a new starting crop to start growing. This meant taking a team out into the wild to find and gather some wild seaweed. Ideally, we wanted the same species of seaweed we had been growing before. Right now, we are focusing on a red seaweed known as Gracilaria . Gracilaria is a useful and popular red seaweed. Different species of Gracilaria are grown in other parts of the world. Here in Jamaica, we call it “irish moss” and traditionally for it, but our company is among the first to farm it. Here you can see some of the Gracilaria from our first round of collection dives. This specific species is called Gracilaria domingensis.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the irish moss in hand\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the Irish Moss on the beach from our first trip to White Horses"

    "text": "The Start\nI’ll be honest. I had mixed feelings about this trip to start. Our first batch of seaweed came from a site named White Horses in St. Thomas. Its called that because the waves crashing look like..well..white horses. In other words, the water gets pretty rough. The roads to and from that site are pretty rough in their own right. The first trip was pretty rough in its own right. The second trip to White Horses was even worse. That time, the other divers and I had gotten into a mess. We collected no seaweed and almost got ourselves seriously hurt. It was a textbook case of horrible conditions. Visibility was less than three feet, surge was rough and the current pushed us towards rocks with some serious force.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as the leader for the last dive, my team and I made sure we analyzed our loss(after a beer) ad figured out what we could do better. One of the major steps was to reach our dive site early, before the water picked up for the day. We had tried to reach early on the previous trip, but due to circumstances, we didnt reach until 1pm, when the sea was already rough.\nSo this time, we left out at 4:30 am. So after a wonderful 4 hours of sleep, we got driving. A contact had advised us of a new dive site. The drive was long, but they had done some paving on the roads. It wasn’t great, but I could see the improvement. We got to see some nice views on the ride down. Jamaica, especially the parish of Portland, is a beautiful place. Escpecially if you’re like me and love the sea and sea views.\n\n\n\nSunrise in Portland Jamaica\n\n\nWe kept driving and arrived around 8am. And then after stretching our legs, we got to work."

    "text": "The Collection\nOnce we arrived, our guide led us out into the bay, we were expecting shallow water, maybe only 10, 20 feet, but to our surprise it was knee height. The sediment was muddy, and visibility was basically nothing(and yet somehow still better than white horses.) We could feel down and pull up the seaweed. It was another Gracilaria species, but we were more than happy to take it. We didnt need our Scuba gear, so we set it to float at the surface. It helped keep our collection bags off the bottom as well. Then we went gathering up the irish moss. We talked and joked about crocs coming for us while we harvested. It had one of the divers so wound up she jumped at a fish, thinking it was a croc. Eventually the team, after a little more than an hour and a half, made our way back into shore.\nWe talked to some locals who told us how there was plenty of another kind of irish moss nearby and showed us the site. We loaded up our truck, and got moving.\n\n\n\nMe at the site"

    "text": "The Afterwards\nWhen we reached back, we loaded in the seaweed to be sterilised. We try not to bring foreign diseases or organisms into the Bay we work at, Turtle Crawle Bay. We went to check on our oyster crops. We had been drying the little guys to clean off any other sea creatures growing on them. And finally we got out of the water.\nWe tried to rinse our scuba gear, as you always should. Only to find there was no freshwater. So someone working at our partners in the bay, took us to a little roadside waterfall to rinse off…which was also dry. He said he had one more option, and took us through a VERY out of the way path, to a stream where we could rinse our gear and ourselves. We had a little swim and rinse off, and started the drive home.\nAll credit for photos goes out to my team members who took them. In particular I’d love to big up Britney Williams."
