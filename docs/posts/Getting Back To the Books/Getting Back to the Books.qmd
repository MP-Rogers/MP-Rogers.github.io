## 

So, as of late last year(2023), I've decided to start intentionally reading again. Now, as a scientist, (and it still feels so funny to call myself that) It's not like I could ever *truly* stop reading. Whenever something came up, I would always have reports and documents and papers to read. But last year, I chose to kind of take reading back on my terms. Personally, I'm going through a bit of a transition period now in my life, and it felt good to start reading again.

I was a **HUGE** reader as a child, but somewhere along the way I fell off. In a way, this reading was supposed to be self-development or self-improvement, but it was also a way to reconnect to myself.

I started in December last year, so I wouldn't call it a New Year's resolution, but as of today, I've read consistently since then.

## What do I like to read?

So I suppose the best place to start is what I've been reading, and what I like to read. I was a fiction reader, especially as a child. One of the most memorable book series I went through was [Percy Jackson and the Olympians](https://rickriordan.com/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/)(which has recently gotten a Disney plus show I rather enjoyed).

I love fantasy. Fantasy based on old myths and legends has a special place in my heart. I think there's a couple reasons:

1.  My father is still a huge reader and lover of fantasy, so I'm predisposed by nature and nurture.
2.  I love the idea of building on and using old legends.
3.  I love the world building.
4.  I love the grand scale of everything.
5.  And I love how human and relateable the struggles can be, despite the scales and different worlds the writers create.

That said, what I like to read is not the only thing I've been reading since I got back on the reading train. I've made an effort to do two things:

1.  Academic Reading
2.  Reading Wider

I'll address the second one first.

## Reading Wider

I've made an effort to read things I wouldn't normally read. It's important to broaden your perspectives after all. I've read books on personal development like [The Four Agreements](https://www.miguelruiz.com/the-four-agreements) and [Mastery](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13589182-mastery). I've read a little bit on one of Jamaica's National Heroes, my personal favourite, Marcus Garvey for the first time. It turns out he said a lot I agree with and a lot I don't.

I've read books that are "classic" and hard to qualify like [Meditations](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30659.Meditations). And of course I've read my fiction as well. Neil Gaiman's [Anansi Boys](https://www.neilgaiman.com/works/Books/Anansi+Boys/) is probably my favourite book so far, although comparing fiction to non fiction is like apples and oranges. Separate from books like these, I've made an effort to read...

### Academic Reading

I've asked around online for good ways to keep growing and learning after finishing university. It's something I was really concerned about. I want to keep improving, and not be an "ok" marine biologist, but the best one can I be. At the same time, I'm very aware of how easy it is to stagnate, or worse forget what you aren't actively using. So I've made an effort to find some material in my field(marine biology, specifically aquaculture), and try to read through a couple papers a week.

I decided to try and keep the number low so I can actually engage with them properly. Occasionally I stray outside the field(usually somewhere adjacent), but I'm glad to say I'm being pretty consistent. I've put in my own money and subscribed to a journal and I've not regretted it yet.

One thing I've taken to doing is using an online tool called [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product), to help me keep track. Notion is huge, and can do a lot of things. It is potentially a very big system, but to be honest, all I use it for right now is as a library for the literature I read. It's also free(or I use a free version which has pretty much everything but limits sharing).

I use [this template](https://www.notion.so/templates/scientific-papers-knowledge-hub) some kind soul came up with online and record the titles, links and broad topics of the papers I've read. Then I'll write my summaries, insights and ideas into the program, and everything will get stored online. I personally find summarising and engaging like that makes me remember more than just glancing through passively.

## What Have I realised?

I've realised a couple things, but it boils down to "I learn a lot when I read." And I mean that generally. Academic writing is the obvious one, science is cool. But I'm shocked just how much people have done that I have not and would not have heard of otherwise. The knowledge is out there, just waiting for someone to tap it. Maybe you can do something practical with it like I hope to, but you can definitely learn.

But I learn a lot from fiction too. It's like meeting the characters(and the authors). I'd argue some of the personal development I've seen in/learned from characters is as important and useful as the advice in any self help book. There's a reason children are taught with stories. We relate to them in a way we just do not seem to when simply told something.

## What Would I Recommend?

I recommend reading. There's a lot of knowledge out there in books and articles, so much out there its almost crazy. But I fell off myself. I acknowledge reading can be fun and rewarding, but I'd be a liar to say It can't be tedious too. So here's what I did:

### Start Small

I made sure not to take up too much. I stuck to 2 papers a week academically. One so I could engage properly. But also so that I don't miss the goal, get discouraged and stop all together.

### Consistency

I have a timer set to remind me to read at 6:00pm on weekdays. I have preset alarm for half an hour, the time I've decided to read for. Sometimes(often) I end up reading outside the timeslot or for more(or less) time. But the secret is just to keep at it. Even tedious books get worn away with time. That said, tedious books will burn you out. Even moreso if you don't already have a good relationship with reading. So...

### Read what you Enjoy!

This is the closest thing to a secret. We enjoy what we enjoy, so find something you enjoy to read. It's easiest to build habits with something you like or something rewarding. Maybe you have a favourite series based on a book, you can start there. Or find some easy reading, whatever that means to you. Don't feel any sort of way that your choice is silly. Its a story you like, that's valuable enough.

With that said, I'm going to keep reading. I hope you start or continue too. Walk good and happy reading.
